# Hardening Knowledge Base

This repository consolidates technical guidelines, methodologies, and security measures for **hardening systems, infrastructures, and services**.  

The purpose is twofold:  
1. **Provide a consolidated technical reference**, aligned with international security frameworks and standards.  
2. **Demonstrate advanced expertise in defensive cybersecurity**, including secure configurations, automation, and control validation.
