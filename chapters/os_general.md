# üñ•Ô∏è General OS Hardening WIP

## Introduction
Operating systems (OS) are the foundation of IT environments.  
Hardening them properly ensures that applications, services, and networks run on a **secure and resilient base**.  
This chapter describes **general hardening measures** that apply to all operating systems, regardless of vendor or platform.

## Key Principles for OS Hardening

1. **Minimal Installation**  
   - Install only the components, services, and roles required for the system‚Äôs function.  
   - Avoid unnecessary packages, drivers, or demo software.  

2. **Patch and Update Management**  
   - Apply security updates regularly (kernel, libraries, drivers, applications).  
   - Automate updates where possible and verify patch levels.  

3. **Account and Access Control**  
   - Enforce strong password and authentication policies.  
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC).  
   - Disable or remove default and unused accounts.  

4. **Privilege Management**  
   - Apply the principle of least privilege.  
   - Use dedicated administrative accounts, not shared credentials.  
   - Separate normal user accounts from administrative ones.  

5. **Service and Process Control**  
   - Disable or remove unnecessary services.  
   - Limit background processes to reduce attack surface.  
   - Monitor active processes regularly.  

6. **Logging and Auditing**  
   - Enable system and security logs.  
   - Centralize logs when possible (SIEM, syslog).  
   - Monitor for unusual activity (failed logins, privilege escalations).  

7. **File System and Permissions**  
   - Restrict permissions to critical system directories.  
   - Enforce secure ownership and group settings.  
   - Enable disk encryption for sensitive data.  

8. **Network Configuration**  
   - Close unused ports.  
   - Restrict inbound/outbound traffic with firewalls.  
   - Enforce secure protocols (SSH, TLS) instead of insecure ones (Telnet, FTP).

## Common Hardening Techniques
- **Baseline templates** ‚Üí Apply organization-approved OS baselines (CIS, STIG, ISO).  
- **Configuration management** ‚Üí Use Ansible, Puppet, or Group Policies to enforce settings.  
- **Secure boot and BIOS/UEFI settings** ‚Üí Disable boot from removable media, set firmware passwords.  
- **Application whitelisting** ‚Üí Prevent unauthorized software execution.  
- **Endpoint protection** ‚Üí Deploy anti-malware, EDR, or host-based IDS/IPS solutions.

## Validation and Monitoring
- Regular vulnerability scans against OS hosts.  
- Compliance checks using **SCAP/OVAL** standards.  
- Continuous monitoring of logs, integrity, and baseline deviations.

## Summary
General OS hardening provides a **unified foundation** for securing operating systems, regardless of whether they are Linux, Windows, or macOS.  
By minimizing exposure, enforcing strict access controls, and monitoring continuously, organizations can ensure their systems are resilient against common threats.
