# Security Baselines

## What is a Security Baseline?
A **security baseline** is a predefined set of security configurations and controls that establish the minimum required level of protection for a system, application, or environment; and acts as the foundation for secure deployments and ensures consistency across an organization‚Äôs infrastructure.

**¬∑ REMEMBER**: the baseline depends both on the project and the security level required for its operation, so each one will requiere special attention in orden to achieve better results.

## Purpose of Security Baselines
- **Consistency** ‚Äì ensures that all systems follow the same security requirements. 
- **Compliance** ‚Äì aligns with standards such as CIS, STIG, NIST, ANSSI or CCN-STIC or specific client requirements.
- **Efficiency** ‚Äì provides a starting point for hardening activities, avoiding ad-hoc configurations.  
- **Scalability** ‚Äì simplifies secure deployments in large infrastructures or cloud environments.

## Characteristics of a Good Baseline
- **Auditability** ‚Äì enables security teams to verify if systems are properly configured.  
- **Standardized** ‚Äì based on recognized frameworks and adapted to organizational needs.  
- **Tested** ‚Äì validated for compatibility with operational requirements.  
- **Documented** ‚Äì includes clear instructions, references, and rationale for each control.  
- **Automated** ‚Äì implemented with configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, PowerShell DSC, Group Policy).  
- **Versioned** ‚Äì tracked over time to reflect updates in technology and threat landscape.

## Examples of Security Baselines
- **Operating Systems**:  
  - Disable unused services.  
  - Specific password complexity and lockout policies.  
  - Enable logging and auditing.  

- **Network Devices**:  
  - Default credentials removed.  
  - Specific ports available..
  - Strong encryption cyphers and protocols.
  
- **Physical security**:  
  - Role definition for personnel.
  - Restrict access to server rooms and rack locks.
  - Ensure redundant power via UPS/generators.

- **Applications**:  
  - Secure default configuration (no anonymous access, no debug endpoints exposed).  
  - Second Factor Authentication requirement.
  - Access control and Role-based access control (RBAC).  
  - Periodicity of patch management.

## Baseline Development Process
1. **Identify Standards** ‚Äì choose CIS, STIG, or industry-specific references. This may vary depending  on the country where the project its hosted.
2. **Customize Controls** ‚Äì adapt to organizational context and operational needs.  
3. **Test in Non-Production** ‚Äì validate against real workloads to ensure no disruptions.  
4. **Deploy at Scale** ‚Äì enforce baseline across all relevant systems.  
5. **Monitor & Update** ‚Äì continuously improve and patch deviations.

## Tools for Managing Baselines
- **Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)** ‚Äì Windows baselines.  
- **Ansible Playbooks / Puppet / Chef** ‚Äì automation of Linux/Unix baselines.  
- **SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)** ‚Äì standardized security configurations.  
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** ‚Äì baseline validation in cloud environments.

## Summary
Security baselines represent the **minimum security posture** an organization should enforce.  
They ensure consistency, reduce misconfigurations, and provide a repeatable foundation for hardening, auditing, and compliance activities.
